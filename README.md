# Top Movies
 
The top 50 Movies IMDB application is a Shiny application incorporating elements of `rvest`, `shiny`, and `highcharter` to produce a dynamically rendered set of tables and pie charts. 

To learn more about the application, how it was developed, and how to create your own Shiny app please visit [my project page](https://www.richardshanna.com/project/shiny_rvest/).
